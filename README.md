# VueJS_IntroductionProject_MonsterSlayer

This **introduction project** was made in Vue.js while following ***[a course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide)*** made to learn this ***front-end framework*** thoroughly.

## Thanks to this project, I learned several key features including

- **Methods, computed properties and data** and ***when*** to use them.
- **Conditionnal displaying** with *v-if*, *v-else-if* and *v-else*
- **Using Data** to *influence CSS classes*
- Using **events listener** to *execute methods*

You can see the result here : **[Monster Slayer](https://jps09.github.io/VueJS_IntroductionProject_MonsterSlayer)**
